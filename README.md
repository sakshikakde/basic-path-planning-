# basic-path-planning-
Implementation of basic path planning algorithms like Dijkstar, A star etc on  visiblity graph using MATLAB.     

The map can be a grid based map or a visiblity graph. The repository tries to solve the planning problem on a visiblity graph.      
Follwing are the conditions that are assumed:-    
1)The robot and obstacle aare convex ploygons     
2)The robot is assumed to be circular.    
3)Currently,the codes are working for sigle obstacle in its configurational space.    


For Dijkstar Algorithm    
Run the codes in the following sequence:-   
1)Run script.m    
2)Run shortest_path.m   
3)run trace_path.m
